OpenGL ES 3.0 Programming On Android
===============================

This repository contains the sample code for learning opengl ES 3.0 using native c/c++.
*Currently this project's core C++ engine is under active development, not guarantee build successfully on branch "master",but you still can switch to branch "branch-c" for successfully building a older-version app *

## Features ##
* Focus on mobile(Android/IOS) gles3.0+
* Use native c/c++ and pure gles api
* Use [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.6/index.html) for Math
* Nice framework and examples borrow from a couple of projects (see below)
* Plenty examples in a single app for demo
* Use Gradle for Building On Android, easy to build

*Framework code inspired by:*

* [OpenGL ES 3.0 Programming Guide](http://www.opengles-book.com)
* [OpenGL Shader Language Cookbook](https://github.com/daw42/glslcookbook)

*Examples are inspired by:*

* [OpenGL ES 3.0 Programming Guide](http://www.opengles-book.com)
* [Nehe OpenGL's Lesson](http://nehe.gamedev.net/)
* [OpenGL Shader Language Cookbook](https://github.com/daw42/glslcookbook)
